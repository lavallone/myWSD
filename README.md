## ðŸŸ£ Analyzing Homonymy Disambiguation
In *1. Homonyms Analysis* folder is present my contribution to the paper "***Analyzing Homonymy Disambiguation Capabilities of Pretrained Language Models***" that has been accepted to the LREC-COLING 2024 Conference. 

## ðŸŸ¡ LLMantics: A Novel Benchmark for Measuring Lexical Semantic Capabilities of Instruction-Tuned Large Language Models
In *2. LLMantics* folder there's the code to test LLMs capabilities to perform WSD. *How good  are LLMs in (NLU)?*

## ðŸŸ  Extending LLMantics: Homonymy Disambiguation (HD) with Large Language Models
In *3. HD with LLMs* folder there's the code to test LLMs capabilities to disambiguate homonymy clusters. 

## ðŸ˜· Bag_of_Masks
It's a nice idea for performing *unsupervised WSD* exploiting LM capability to predict ***[MASK]*** tokens. Future research direction ðŸ”®.
